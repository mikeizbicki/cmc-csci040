## About the Course

**General Information:**

1. There are no prerequisites for this course.

1. This course fulfills the math general ed requirements for CMC students.

   But, most students find it much harder than taking MATH030 (Calculus I).
   If you haven't taken calculus, then you will likely have to put in about twice the amount of work on this class than you would to take calculus and get the same grade.

1. This course is similar to [CS5 at Harvey Mudd](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/twiki/bin/view/CS5) or [CS51 at Pomona](http://www.cs.pomona.edu/~tzuyi/Classes/sp18/cs051p/) (and many of the other intro CS courses at the Claremont Colleges).
    1. If you have already taken either of those courses,
       then you cannot take this course.
    1. If you are majoring in computer science at either of those schools,
       then you cannot take this course.
    1. This course is designed for CMC's 
        1. data science major,
        1. data science sequence,
        1. and computer science sequence.
    1. This course is more practical than the Mudd/Pomona courses.

       Lots of the cool applications in the Pomona/Mudd CS curriculum are "reserved" for their upper division class,
       but I've included them directly in this intro course.

    1. This course is especially designed to connect computer science to non-STEM subjects like
        1. economics,
        1. government,
        1. literature, and
        1. history.

1. This course cannot be taken CR/NC.

**Primary Learning Objectives:**

1. **Automate boring tasks** <-- this is a hacker's primary goal

1. Understand basic:
    1. internet infrastructure
    1. common programming jargon
        1. ["front end" versus "back end" development](https://www.coursereport.com/blog/front-end-development-vs-back-end-development-where-to-start)
        1. [test driven development](https://streamhacker.com/2009/02/05/test-driven-development-in-python/)
    1. [accessible development](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility)
        1. allow blind people to use webpages
        1. allow non-English speaking / non-Americans to use your software
    1. web security
        1. technical details (you will learn to commit fraud in this class... but obviously you shouldn't!)
        1. social implications
        1. government policy
        1. legal issues
    1. [search engine optimization](https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo)
1. Use real-world programming tools
    1. Python libraries actually in use at [FAANG companies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/faang-stocks.asp)
    1. GitHub (which is different than git, something we'll learn in the follow-on class CS46)

**Textbook:**

There is nothing to buy for this class.
All of our references are [free as in beer](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/free_as_in_beer).
Some of them are also [free as in speech](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/free_as_in_speech).

1. Shay Howe's [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/).
1. Al Sweigart's [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).
1. Lots of other online resources as provided in the weekly schedule.

<!--
Hackers believe in the free exchange of information and often use the following websites to share textbooks and other knowledge:

1. https://b-ok.org
1. https://sci-hub.tw
1. https://thepiratebay.org

But most of the people who use these sites are [script kiddies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie).
-->

**Grades:**

| category                      | points/assignment | *approximate* percentage |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- | ---- |
| labs (weekly)                 | 2-5pts            | 20%  |
| quizzes (weekly)              | 5pts              | 40%  |
| projects (every 2-3 weeks)    | 5-20pts           | 40%  |

This will be a low-stress but **very** challenging class.

1. The course is low-stress because you have full control over what your grade will be.
    1. **No midterm/final exam.**
       Weekly quizzes ensure you don't fall behind on material, and if you bomb a quiz it's not a big deal.

       1. You can retake 1 quiz in this class without any penalty if you don't like your grade for any reason.
          You must do the retake within 1 week of the original quiz date.

          The first two quizzes can be retaken without any penalty.

       1. Quizzes will be open note, and you will have "unlimited" time.

       1. Final project due during finals week.

    1. Most weekly labs are automatically graded by Python.
       Keep working on them until you get 100%.
    1. Projects have TONs of extra credit opportunities.
       In the past, I've had students end the course with a 150%,
       and I've had other students choose not to complete certain projects because they would get an A without completing them.

1. The material is intrinsically *very* hard.
    1. That's why CS/DS majors get paid so much money... there's not many people willing to work hard enough to master these concepts.
    1. That's why we have an extra lab session each week (and so 50% more in-person instruction time).
       Also take advantage of office hours and the QCL.

       <!--
       Historically, the average student needs to spend about 10 hours per week outside of class to get an A.
       About 50% of students will either:
       spend 15-20 hours per week and get an A-/A,
       or spend 10 hours per week and get a B/C.
       -->

       > **NOTE:**
       > One point corresponds to approximately 1 hour of work for the average student to earn an A on the assignment.
       > There will be approximately 200 points in the class, or roughly 12.5 points/week.
       > Historically, some students need to spend 20+ hours per week to earn an A/A-.

1. The projects are designed to be fun, real-world projects:

    |     | Project                 | Difficulty    | Due date will be no earlier than |
    | --- | ----------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
    | 0   | Building a Webpage      | Easy          | Sunday, 11 Sep   |
    | 1   | Markdown compiler       | Hard          | Sunday, 02 Oct   |
    | 2   | Data visualization      | Medium        | Sunday, 09 Oct   |
    | 3   | Scraping ebay           | Medium        | Sunday, 23 Oct   |
    | 4   | Reddit propaganda bot   | Hard          | Sunday, 06 Nov   |
    | 5   | Twitter clone           | Hard          | Sunday, 11 Dec   |

    <!--
    There's also fewer projects than in CS5/CS51.
    Those courses have 1 project per week.
    -->

Your final grade will be computed according to the following table,
with one caveat.

| If your grade satisfies          | then you earn |
| -------------------------------- | ------------- |
| 95 &le; grade                    | A             |
| 90 &le; grade < 95               | A-            |
| 87 &le; grade < 90               | B+            |
| 83 &le; grade < 87               | B             |
| 80 &le; grade < 83               | B-            |
| 77 &le; grade < 80               | C+            |
| 73 &le; grade < 77               | C             |
| 70 &le; grade < 73               | C-            |
| 67 &le; grade < 70               | D+            |
| 63 &le; grade < 67               | D             |
| 60 &le; grade < 63               | D-            |
| 60 > grade                       | F             |

*CAVEAT:*
In order to earn an A/A- in the class, you must also complete one of the following tasks.

1. Watch the following shows/movies about hacking:

    1. Season 1 of Mr. Robot (available of [Amazon Prime](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B00YBX664Q)).
       This is the most accurate portrayal of hacking in any movie, see for example [this article](https://www.pri.org/stories/how-realistic-are-hacks-mr-robot) and [this article](https://www.wired.com/2016/07/real-hackers-behind-mr-robot-get-right/).

    1. War Games (available on [Amazon Prime](https://www.amazon.com/Wargames-Matthew-Broderick/dp/B083FY4CDG/)).
       This is a classic hacker movie and was quite realistic for what hacking looked like when the movie was released (1983).

    1. CitizenFour (available for free from the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/Citizen.Four2014)).
       This is a documentary about Edward Snowden and the hacking that the NSA does.
       There's also a live-action movie called [Snowden](https://www.amazon.com/Snowden-Joseph-Gordon-Levitt/dp/B01LWYVHKV) that you could also choose to watch.

    1. Zero Days - Security Leaks for Sale (available for free on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BTTiWkdT8Q))

    <!--
    1. Season 1 of Hunted, [available online](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/hunted/on-demand/60136-001).
       This is a reality TV show about how your cellphones and web browsing traffic can let people track you.
    -->

1. Read [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](https://hpmor.com).
   This is a fanfic written by [Eliezer Yudkowsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky),
   who is a famous [AI safety](https://futureoflife.org/ai-safety-research/) researcher.
   The premise is that Harry Potter's parents were both wizards and scientists,
   and the story introduces a lot of concepts important for AI safety and the philosophy of data science.

   > **NOTE:**
   > This is a LONG reading (roughly the equivalent of 2-3 books).
   > Watching the shows/movies is the most efficient option time-wise.

See [Issue #260](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci040/issues/260) for instructions on how to get credit for completing these readings / viewings.

**Late Work Policy:**

You lose 20% on labs/projects for each day late.
It is still typically better to submit a correct assignment late than an incorrect one on time.

If you collaborate with other students or visit the QCL for help with an assignment,
you get an automatic 2 day extension on any lab or project.

**Collaboration Policy:**

<!--
Harvard CS50:

> When asking for help, you may show your code to others, but you may not view theirs.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0z-yIp1PnE
-->

You are encouraged to discuss all labs and projects with other students,
subject to the following constraints:

1. you must be the person typing in all code for your assignments, and
1. you must not copy another student's code.

You may use any online resources you like as references.

Basically, I'm trusting you all to be adults.
You are ultimately responsible for ensuring you learn the material!
So do what will help you learn best.

> **WARNING:**
> All material in this class is cumulative.
> If you work "too closely" with another student on an assignment,
> you won't understand how to complete subsequent assignments,
> and you will quickly fall behind.
> You should view collaboration as a way to improve your understanding,
> not as a way to do less work.

## Accommodations for Disabilities

I've tried to design the course to be as accessible as possible for people with disabilities.
(We'll talk a bit about how to design accessible software in class too!)
If you need any further accommodations, please ask.

I want you to succeed and I'll make every effort to ensure that you can.

<!--

make labs due during the lab session; -1 point penalty for submitting late

change the requirements of hw_00 to have:
- a legitimate title bar and consistent formatting between pages
- no broken links
- no inline styles/no style tags
- no broken html tags like "html>"

introduce pythontutor before doing python in vscode?

Trick questions:
 1. += vs =+
 1. while n:
        n //= 10
 1. for i in range(-5, 5):
        if i:
            do something

Functions:
1. Create functions with default valued arguments
1. Call functions with named arguments (in different orders)/variable number of arguments
1. Call functions from within functions, actually using the returned result (return vs print)

students don't understand functions and the difference of return/print

for loop flags; the reddit assignment looping to see if a comment has a reply needs a boolean flag; we should visit this patter earlier in the class

difference between pass vs continue

blah(
    username=xxx
)
print(username) # generates an error

call a function without parentheses:
def foo():
    print('hello')
    # print vs return
foo

Exceptions:
1. Add ValueError to errors discussion
1. cover when the error happens midway through the try
1. when the error happens in the except clause
1. cover try/except within try/except

SQL:
1. More step-by-step lab instructions
1. Do lab with just SQL+Python before involving flask

================================================================================

More patterns:

students struggle with nested lists/dictionaries; do more examples early on

dictionary pattern where we have a list of items,
and we use dictionary keys as the items and values as the counts

dictionary/json pprint

wait for dictionaries with JSON?  students have a LOT of trouble with dictionary indexing

list like objects especially with praw not giving lists back

str(comment.author)

for comment in comments:
    do comment
comment

for word in string is wrong

if list == 0 instead of len(list)==0


for comment.reply in comments.reply


random.choice([])


students don't understand the ? syntax in sql do quiz wth '?' vs ? and other insert syntax variations with python; last quiz was just sql, which wasn't enough; need for con.commit() and cur.fetchall()

insert into users (username,password) values (username=?,password=?);



students forget that you need parenthesis to call a function
con.commit
vs
con.commit()



request.form.get('message')
select message from messages;
message  <<-- students don't understand why you can't refer to just message in python
