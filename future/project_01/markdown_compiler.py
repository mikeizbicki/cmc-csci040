'''
This script converts markdown documents into HTML documents.

Each function has its own doctests (just like in lab),
and you should begin this assignment by solving the doctests.
This will let you focus on completing just one small piece of the assignment at a time and not get lost in the "big picture".
Then, once all of these small pieces are complete,
the entire assignment will work "magically".

Dividing up a large project into smaller "doctestable" components is more of an art than a science.
As you get more experience programming,
you'll slowly learn how to divide up your code this way for yourself.
This is one of the main skills that separates senior programmers from junior programmers.

There's a handful of coding techniques in here that we haven't covered in class and you're not expected to understand.
This is intentional.
An important skill when learning a programming language is being able to work in an environment that you don't 100% understand.
(Again, this is similar to when learning a human language...
when we learn a new human languages,
we won't 100% understand everything in the new language,
but we still have to be able to work with the parts that we do understand.)

def compile_headers(line):
    '''
    Convert markdown headers into <h1>,<h2>,etc tags.

    HINT:
    This is the simplest function to implement in this assignment.
    Use a slices to extract the first part of the line,
    then use if statements to check if they match the appropriate header markdown commands.

    >>> compile_headers('# This is the main header')

def compile_italic_star(line):
    '''
    Convert "*italic*" into "<i>italic</i>".

    HINT:
    Italics require carefully tracking the beginning and ending positions of the text to be replaced.
    This is similar to the `delete_HTML` function that we implemented in class.
    It's a tiny bit more complicated since we are not just deleting substrings from the text,
    but also adding replacement substrings.

    >>> compile_italic_star('*This is italic!* This is not italic.')
    '<i>This is italic!</i> This is not italic.'

    '_'
    '''

def compile_strikethrough(line):
    '''
    Convert "~~strikethrough~~" to "<ins>strikethrough</ins>".

    HINT:
    The strikethrough annotations are very similar to implement as the italic function.
    The difference is that there are two delimiting characters instead of one.
    This will require carefully thinking about the range of your for loop and all of your list indexing.

    >>> compile_strikethrough('~~This is strikethrough!~~ This is not strikethrough.')
    '<ins>This is strikethrough!</ins> This is not strikethrough.'
    >>> compile_strikethrough('~~This is strikethrough!~~')

    '''
    return line


def compile_code_inline(line):
    '''
    Add <code> tags.

    HINT:
    This function is like the italics functions because inline code uses only a single character as a delimiter.
    It is more complex, however, because inline code blocks can contain valid HTML inside of them,
    but we do not want that HTML to get rendered as HTML.
    Therefore, we must convert the `<` and `>` signs into `&lt;` and `&gt;` respectively.

    >>> compile_code_inline('You can use backticks like this (`1+2`) to include code in the middle of text.')
    'You can use backticks like this (<code>1+2</code>) to include code in the middle of text.'
    >>> compile_code_inline('This is inline code: `1+2`')

    '''
    return line


def compile_links(line):
    '''
    Add <a> tags.

    HINT:
    The links and images are potentially more complicated because they have many types of delimeters: `[]()`.
    These delimiters are not symmetric, however, so we can more easily find the start and stop locations using the strings find function.

    >>> compile_links('Click on the [course webpage](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci040)!')

    So your code here should be based off of the <a> tag code.

    >>> compile_images('[Mike Izbicki](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1052630?v=2&s=460)')

def compile_lines(text):
    r'''
    Apply all markdown transformations to the input text.

    NOTE:
    This function calls all of the functions you created above to convert the full markdown file into HTML.
    This function also handles multiline markdown like <p> tags and <pre> tags;
    because these are multiline commands, they cannot work with the line-by-line style of commands above.

    NOTE:
    The doctests are divided into two sets.
    The first set of doctests below show how this function adds <p> tags and calls the functions above.
    Once you implement the functions above correctly,
    then this first set of doctests will pass.

    NOTE:
    For your assignment, the most important thing to take away from these test cases is how multiline tests can be formatted.

    >>> compile_lines('This is a **bold** _italic_ `code` test.\nAnd *another line*!\n')
