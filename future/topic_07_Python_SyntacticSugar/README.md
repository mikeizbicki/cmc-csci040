"Syntactic Sugar" is a short way of writing common idioms in code.
Python is famous for having lots of syntactic sugar.

We've already seen some examples of syntactic sugar:

List comprehensions are a famous and controversial form of syntactic sugar.
They can simplify your code a lot, or make it difficult to read.
Whether to use them or not is a matter of individual judgement and taste.

In general: `while` loops > `for` loops > list comprehensions

* where `>` should be read as "more powerful than"

## Lab

**Due date:** Halloween, Oct 31

**Overview:**

The purpose of this lab is to review all the concepts we've covered so far in class.
The applications are "scary" and so this review lab has a special due date of Halloween.

There's two parts:

1. The [lab-zipbomb](lab-zipbomb) folder contains instructions on how to crack government secrets using the power of the for loop.

1. And [lab-dracula](lab-dracula) folder has you practicing html and file/string operations by editing the book Dracula to make it even more scary.
