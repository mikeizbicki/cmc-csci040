# Project 02: Visualizing interesting datasets

![comic](convincing.png)

**Description:** 
You will perform a simple data visualization on a dataset of your choice and create a webpage that describes the results.

**Due:** 
Sunday, 23 October, midnight

**Learning objectives:**

1. complete a python project entirely on your own
1. integrate python knowledge with HTML/Markdown knowledge
1. understand how python allows more advanced data analysis than tools like excel

## Instructions

1. Find two datasets that are interesting to you, and download them.
   Good places to look for datasets include:

    1. https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets

    1. https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?res_format=JSON

    1. http://data.un.org/

   You may use any dataset of your choosing, but you may not use the same dataset as any other student who you discuss this project with.

   One of your datasets must be in CSV format, and the other must be in JSON format.
   [Chapter 14 of the textbook](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter14/) includes instructions for working with both types of files.
   <!--
   Some datasets are in CSV format instead of JSON format.
   CSV files are even easier to work with than JSON files,
   and [the book has a whole chapter of examples](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter14/).
   -->

   > **NOTE:**
   > You may not modify the dataset file in anyway.
   > If there is processing that you want to do to the dataset (e.g. computing an average),
   > you must do this within python after loading the file.
   > Additionally, if you are plotting some feature of the dataset,
   > you must include all occurrences of that feature.
   > (For example, if you have year on the x-axis of a plot,
   > you must have ALL of the years present in the dataset on the x-axis.)

1. Generate two plots, one from each of your datasets, satisfying the following requirements:

    1. You may select any type of plot that you want (e.g., line, bar, scatter, etc.),
       but you must select two different plot types.

    1. At least one of your plots must contain two different data sources, and you must have a key that shows the meaning of each data source.
       (For example, two different lines in a line graph, 
       or two different sets of bars in a bar chart).

       > **WARNING:**
       > In the past, it has been common for students to miss points on this assignment for not including multiple data sources in a single plot.

    1. The plots should have properly labeled x and y axes.

    1. The tic labels for both the x and y axes should appear in a reasonable order (e.g. years should be sorted low to high),
       and they must be legible.

    1. Your plots must be overall "reasonable."
       There are too many ways to list about how a plot might be unreasonable,
       so if you have any questions about whether your plot is reasonable,
       then ask me in person before the submission deadline.

       > **HINT:**
       > If your data is appearing as a straight line,
       > then you've probably made a mistake.

   See the [matplotlib samples library](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/tutorials/introductory/sample_plots.html) for examples of well formatted plots.

   Two examples of acceptable plots are:

   <img src=trump_bar.png>

   <img src=trump_line1.png>

   An example of an unacceptable plot is:

   <img src=trump.png>

1. Create a new github repository for this project,
   and get at least 5 stars for your repo.
   Inside the repo there should be:

   1. The two image files that contain your plots

   1. The python file that generates the plots

   1. Any JSON/CSV files needed to reproduce the plots

   1. A `README.md` markdown file that describes your project.

1. Inside your `README.md` file, you should:

    1. Use appropriate markdown formatting.

        1. Use an h1 header (`#`) at the top of the file

        1. Use either an h2 header (`##`) or bold (`**`) to create titles for your plots

        1. Ensure that the text is broken up into reasonably sized paragraphs
    
    1. For each plot: 

        1. Include the image using appropriate markdown commands
    
        1. You should have a short 2-5 sentence description that describes the data you plotted

        1. The description should include a link to the original data source.
           This should not be a link to your data on github,
           but a link to the original website you downloaded the data from.

    1. Include a link to the project instructions (this webpage)

1. Upload a link to your github repo to sakai.

## Grading rubric

Each plot is worth 6 points.

Your github repo is worth 3 points.

<!--
## Extra credit

You can receive 1 point of extra credit if you use the mpld3 extension to matplotlib to generate interactive html plots and include those in your webpage.
See the [mpld3 examples library](https://mpld3.github.io/examples/index.html) for examples of how to do this.
