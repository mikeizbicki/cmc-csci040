We will be covering how to use the PRAW library this week for making reddit bots.
The textbook does not cover this topic,
but you can find the library's (excellent) documentation here:
<https://praw.readthedocs.io/>

You will need to:

1. create a new reddit account just for this class at the link <https://www.reddit.com/login/>

    1. the word `bot` must be in the account name somewhere

    1. do not include personally identifying information in the account name

1. create a reddit "script application" at the link <https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps>
