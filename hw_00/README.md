**NOTE:** 
If you believe that one of these checkboxes is not appropriate for your webpage for some reason,
post an issue to github and I may grant you an exception.

### Extra Credit: Social Media Engagement

There is no explicit requirement that your webpage "look nice" or have "good content" as these criteria are too subjective to grade.
Instead, you can earn extra credit points by making your webpage look nice and have good content.

In particular, you can get 1 pt of extra credit by completing either of the following tasks.
(Thus the maximum score on this assignment is 11/10.)

 - [ ] 
    Post your site to reddit and get at least 100 upvotes.
    These upvotes must be on a single submission, and not cumulative over several submissions.
    To get ideas on how to make a successful post, [read this reddit thread on getting upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/729fo8/how_do_some_reddit_posts_get_thousands_of_upvotes/) and [learn about reddit's ranking algorithms here](https://medium.com/hacking-and-gonzo/how-reddit-ranking-algorithms-work-ef111e33d0d9).

 - [ ] 
    Get more than 1000 unique visitors to your webpage in a single 48 hour period, as shown by your Google Analytics tracker.

For any of these extra credit tasks, feel free to get creative and use whatever "black hat" techniques you can think of.

## Submission

Upload the URL of your webpage to sakai.

If you also completed extra credit,
take a screenshot proving you completed the extra credit,
and upload that to sakai.
