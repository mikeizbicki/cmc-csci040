# Topc 11: SQL

<img width=600px src=dilbert5.jpg />

So far we've seen two types of languages:

1. **Markup**: HTML/CSS, Markdown

   Tell the computer WHAT to DISPLAY, and the computer figures out HOW to do it

1. **Procedural**: Python

   Tell the computer step by step exactly HOW to accomplish ANY TASK

SQL is an example of a **declarative** language.
In SQL, you tell the computer WHAT to COMPUTE,
and the computer figures out HOW automatically.

SQL is arguably the most important language for data scientists.
For example:

1. All interactive webpages use a SQL database to store user content.
    Data scientists run SQL code to extract and process this information.

1. Most technical interviews will do advanced SQL problems.
    To get a job as a data scientist, you'll have to write SQL code live in front of your future boss.

In this class, we won't cover advanced SQL concepts.
(That will be covered in CSCI036 and CSCI133.)
Instead, we'll be covering how to connect SQL to Python...
basically the "why should I care" aspect of SQL.

You'll need to know the following SQL commands:

1. CREATE: <https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_create_table.asp>

1. INSERT: <https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_insert.asp>

1. SELECT: <https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_select.asp>

1. UPDATE: <https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_update.asp>

1. DELETE: <https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_delete.asp>

We'll use the following reference for connecting SQL to python:
